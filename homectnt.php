<b><i>Fashion</b></i> is more than just clothing; it reflects the wider spectrum of aesthetics, art and
design trends in contemporary society. This makes it a multi-faceted word engaging with
a range of surrounding influences. In simple terms, fashion is a social process by which
newly introduced styles or trends become popular in a certain time with acceptability by a
wider cross-section of consumers.</p>
Clothing is a general term referring to actual objects related to the human body.

Apparel refers to garments made of fabric, knits, leather or other wearable materials.

Costume is derived from word 'custom' evolving from the environment and customs of
society. It refers to clothing for a specific use - be it for a ritual or performance, ethnic or
historical within a specific context of occasion and time.

To understand contemporary fashion within a context, it is essential to know its origin
and evolutionary process. The knowledge of fashion and costume history is important
since they are the inevitable outcome of the socio-cultural-political influences prevalent
in society at different points in time.
Clothes are what cover the human body, which in turn, depend on physical conditions like
climate, geographical area, available raw material, textiles etc. Clothes indicate social
significance like religious beliefs and aesthetics; exhibit individual status; proclaim
alliance with or create differentiation among a group. Items of clothing and accessories
would be included in the vocabulary of clothing.
There are several points of views regarding the origin and need for clothing. One school of
thought believes that man covered his body for protecting himself from the vagaries of
climate and nature. Psychologists and ethnologists refer to psychological reasons like the
fig leaf used by Adam and Eve as a symbol of modesty referred to in the Bible.
Anthropologists cite reasons associated with taboo as well as the desire for personal adornment to please both oneself and others. Psychologists propound the view that
human being like to modify their appearance - the use of body covering is one such type of
modification. Other ways for achieving this is through varying hairstyles, alteration of
shape and surface of the body through clothes, body adornment etc. Such changes are
done in order to make the self, more acceptable to others so that there is a commonality
and bonding with the others within the same social 'tribe'.
Primitive men covered their body with animal skin and fur which were shaped to parts of
the human body. Different sizes, shapes and textures of skins would have necessitated
varying approaches to their use and function when applied to cover or adorn the human
figure. Later they used tree bark fibre to protect themselves against extremities of
climate. However clothes are not merely utilitarian but have a deeper significance. The
co-relation between the belief of primitive men in magic and representation of successful
hunting through cave paintings dates back to the early Paleolithic period. Even today,
certain tribes that normally live naked also wear clothes on special occasions!
