* Fashion is a word that itself has many hidden aspects. People follow fashion due to various reasons depending on their life style, personality and way of expressing themselves. Some adopt being fashionable as their profession. It is observed that most of the young girls are obsessed with fashion and spent a lot of money on fashion accessories.</p>

* Trend reports are normally based on what’s been shown on the runway. But the prevalence of a certain color or pattern doesn’t necessarily mean people are interested in it. Fashion will always be an industry for visionaries – creative people who push design ideas the mass market didn’t know they wanted until seeing them. That said, fashion shows and presentations are no longer industry only events. They’re part of the marketing mix to reach customers, and through social media the fan, editor, buyer and shopper can all contribute to the data that exposes where interest is highest.</p>
