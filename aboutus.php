<center><u><p style="font-size:30px">About Us & We are</p></u></center><br>

<p class="indent">
We, fashion designers study trends and sketch the initial clothing or accessory design. We attend trade shows or visit manufacturers to select fabrics and trims.<br>

Designers conduct fittings and adjustments on prototypes of their designs, and the end product is then marketed to clothing retailers. We oversee the entire garment production from their initial sketch to final manufacturing.<br>

The nature of our job varies among the different types of fashion designers; most designers are employed by design and manufacturing firms and work regular hours, while some designers are freelance and work longer hours under more stressful conditions.<br>

Working at a smaller firm often means we designers are responsible for greater duties such as patternmaking and sewing, while larger houses employ a separate team for these tasks.<br>

The design and production process can differ between mass market and high fashion. Some designers specialize in one category of apparel, while others design across a range of clothing and accessories.<br>

Designers communicate with clients worldwide, and therefore their work involves extensive travel.
<br>
Aspiring fashion designers should earn an associates or bachelors degree in fashion design. A joint degree in business, marketing, or merchandising can also be helpful for starting your own business. So here we are, a small group of designers got together to give you the best fashion experience possible. We are London based international clothing providers.
